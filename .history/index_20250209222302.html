    <h1 style="color:black;text-align: center;">Exploring Rental Affordability and cycling station near etablissement in France: An Interactive Data Visualization</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    <strong> Research Question: How affordable is it to rent in France? </strong> <br>
    <br>
      In future implementation, we will explore the distribution of cycling stations near the university within each departement. <br>
      For the current version, we have implemented an interactive map of France, in which we can explore the rental affordability for each department. <br>
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        <strong> Data: </strong> Departement data (departements.geojson) and Rental data (departement_rental_data.json) <br> which contains (Q1 and Q3 quantile, average rental price, Min & Max Rents and Department's Code). <br> <br>
        <strong> Guidelines: When scrolling the mouse over the map, it will be pop a legend square including relevant information (box plot, minimum and maximum rent, etc) to answer our research question.</strong>

      <h2>WHAT the visualization shows</h2>
      <p>This visualization focuses on an <span class="highlight">interactive map of France</span>, highlighting the <span class="highlight">rental distribution</span> across its departments (departements):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The map uses <span class="highlight">color gradients</span> to reflect the median rental prices.</li>
        <li>Hovering over a department displays a <span class="highlight">box plot</span> with statistics such as minimum, maximum, and quartiles.</li>
        <li>Additionally, it provides data on <span class="highlight">school distributions</span> and <span class="highlight">cycling station locations</span>, enabling users to explore convenience and transportation factors.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <div class="section">
      <h2>WHO the visualization is for</h2>
      <p>This visualization is designed for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Students and academic staff</span>: Quickly assess rental affordability across different regions and make location decisions based on school distribution and transportation convenience.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Renters, landlords, and real estate professionals</span>: Gain an intuitive understanding of average rental prices across departments.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Policy makers</span>: Observe rental disparities at a macro level to aid in urban planning and public infrastructure investments.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  
    <div class="section">
      <h2>WHY the audience should care</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rental prices significantly affect people’s <span class="highlight">living and quality of life</span>.</li>
          <li>There are considerable <span class="highlight">variations in housing costs and income levels</span> across France, and this map offers a clear visual representation of rental costs.</li>
          <li>The distribution of schools and transportation hubs (e.g., cycling stations) further influences affordability and livability. Understanding these data points can help users make more informed and forward-thinking decisions regarding housing, work, or investment.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>HOW to read the visualization</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Interactive map:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>Hover your mouse over any department to see detailed <span class="highlight">box plot statistics</span> (Min/Q1/Median/Q3/Max) and the average rental price. Darker colors generally indicate higher rental costs.</li>
              <li>Clicking on a department zooms in and focuses on that area, showing its internal <span class="highlight">public/private schools</span> and <span class="highlight">cycling station capacity</span>.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Legend and tooltips:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>The legend on the right or bottom explains the meaning of the rental color scale, the distinction between high/low-capacity cycling stations, and the icons for public and private schools.</li>
              <li>Hovering over icons reveals <span class="highlight">tooltips</span> that display additional details about specific schools or stations.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Pie Chart (if present):</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>A pie chart next to the map shows the <span class="highlight">distribution of schools</span> across departments (or other related statistics). Departments with small proportions are grouped into “Others” to make the chart more comprehensible.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
